# Core Web Vitals
Definition:
â†’ Set of metrics by Google to measure real-world page experience and performance

# Three Main Metrics:
LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Loading performance â€” should be â‰¤ 2.5s
FID (First Input Delay): Interactivity â€” should be â‰¤ 100ms
CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Visual stability â€” should be â‰¤ 0.1

Why Important:
Directly impacts SEO ranking and user satisfaction
Slow or unstable pages cause higher bounce rates

ðŸ”¹ 1. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) â€” Loading Performance
What it measures: How long it takes for the largest visible element (like an image or text block) to appear on the screen.
Good score: â‰¤ 2.5 seconds
Why it matters: It tells how quickly users can see the main content.
Example:
If your hero image or title loads slowly, LCP will be poor.

# How to Improve in React:
Use code-splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense to load non-critical components later.
Optimize images (use next/image, responsive formats like WebP, and lazy loading).
Preload important assets (fonts, hero images).
Use server-side rendering (SSR) or static generation for faster first render.
Minimize render-blocking scripts and CSS (load scripts asynchronously).


ðŸ”¹ 2. FID (First Input Delay) â€” Interactivity
What it measures: The time between a userâ€™s first interaction (like clicking a button) and the browserâ€™s response.
Good score: â‰¤ 100 milliseconds
Why it matters: It shows how quickly your site reacts to user input.
Example:
If JavaScript is blocking the main thread, buttons feel unresponsive.
# ðŸš€ How to Improve in React:
Avoid heavy JavaScript execution on the main thread.
Use web workers for expensive computations.
Split large bundles using dynamic imports.
Debounce user inputs for search or filters.
Use Reactâ€™s concurrent features (useTransition, useDeferredValue) to keep UI responsive.

ðŸ”¹ 3. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) â€” Visual Stability
What it measures: How much content unexpectedly shifts while the page loads.
Good score: â‰¤ 0.1
Why it matters: Prevents users from clicking the wrong thing due to layout jumps.
Example:
If ads or images load late and push text down, CLS will increase.
# ðŸš€ How to Improve in React:
Set fixed height/width for images and videos.
Avoid injecting new DOM elements above existing content (e.g., ads or popups).
Reserve space for dynamically loaded content.
Use font-display: swap to prevent invisible text shifts.

# Common Interview Q&A Points

Q: What are Core Web Vitals?
A: Metrics for page load speed, interactivity, and visual stability â€” LCP, FID, CLS.

Q: How do you improve LCP in React?
A: Lazy load images/components, preload key assets, SSR/SSG.

Q: How do you improve FID?
A: Reduce JS execution, memoize heavy components, use Web Workers.

Q: How do you improve CLS?
A: Set fixed sizes for images/fonts, avoid layout shifts.

Q: What tools do you use to measure Web Vitals?
A: Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, web-vitals package.

Q: How does code splitting help Web Vitals?
A: Reduces initial JS size â†’ faster LCP & better FID.

Q: What is difference between TTFB and LCP?
A: TTFB = server response time; LCP = main content render time.

Q: How do React.memo and useMemo improve performance?
A: Prevent unnecessary re-renders and heavy computations.
