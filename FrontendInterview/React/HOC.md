# Definition:  
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React
for reusing component logic.
They are functions that take a component and returns a new component with enhanced functionalities or modified behavior.

# Why Use HOCs?
1. # Reusability: 
Share common functionality (e.g., authentication, data fetching) across multiple components without duplicating code.

# How to Use HOCs
1. Create an HOC Function:  
     1.1 It accepts a component and returns a new enhanced component.
     1.2 Convention: Prefix HOC names with with (e.g., withAuth).
2. Implement Logic:
     2.1 Add reusable logic (e.g., data fetching, subscription handlers).
     2.2 Pass new props to the wrapped component.
3. Pass Through Unrelated Props:
3.1 Use the spread operator (...props) to ensure props not related to the HOC are passed to the wrapped component.
