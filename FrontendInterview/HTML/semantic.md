1. def:::: Semantic HTML refers to HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning and structure of the content they contain

Examples of non-semantic tags: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <article>, and <footer> give both the browser and developers a better understanding of the content's role.

Example to Support Your Answer:

<article>
  <header>
    <h2>Blog Post Title</h2>
  </header>
  <p>This is the body of the article.</p>
  <footer>Written by Jane</footer>
</article>

This structure tells the browser and screen readers, “This is an article with a heading and a footer,” improving accessibility, SEO, and code clarity.
