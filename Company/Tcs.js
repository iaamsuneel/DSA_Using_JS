Second Round Interview Experience at NeoSOFT

In my previous post, I shared the 1st round interview questions.
This time, I’ll walk you through my 2nd round experience 👇

🔹 The round started with a short introduction and experience-based discussion, where I explained the features I developed in past projects.
🔹 I was then asked to rate myself out of 5 on HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.
I gave myself an average 3.8, and I also told the interviewer that with the correct use of AI tools, I can easily push myself beyond 4.5+ 🚀
