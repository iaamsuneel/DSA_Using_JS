You have to maximize the profit. 3.)Given an array of characters, reverse the characters of the array without changing the position of the vowels. e.g.['m','n','e', 'p'] O/p---['p','n','e','m'] 4th round-1.)Modified sudoku problem---The sudoku can be 9X9 or 12X12 or 15X15. Tell whether the sudoku is valid or not. 2.)Given an array of repeating and non-repeating numbers. Rearrange it in a way such that no two repeating elements are together. Tell if it is possible or not possible. e.g. 2 2 2 1 3 4 O/p---2 1 2 3 2 4 2 2 2 1 O/p---not possible
