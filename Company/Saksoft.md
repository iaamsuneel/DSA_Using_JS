6. Dynamic import
 Dynamic import is used for lazy loading modules or components in React or Next.js. It helps in code splitting — meaning, splitting large bundles into smaller chunks that load only when required.
 This improves initial page load speed, performance, and user experience.
 For example, I use dynamic import for heavy components like charts, maps, or modals that are not needed at page load.
