# Round 1 – Core JavaScript + ES6

It started with JavaScript fundamentals.
They asked:
Difference between shallow copy and deep copy — and how to make a deep copy using structuredClone, lodash.cloneDeep, and JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()).
What are Symbols in JS?
Explain Promises, async/await, and a basic API call using them.
How debounce helps in API optimization.
What’s the difference between var, let, and const, and how block scope works using IIFE.
Example of multiple inheritance in JS (mixins, Object.assign), since JS doesn’t support it directly.
How parseInt('10hbt') returns 10 — because it parses until it finds a non-digit.
They also threw a few quick ones:
Difference between em and rem in CSS.
Ways to center align a box.
What is eval() and why it should be avoided. */
